This repo contains the code for my MSc final year project, heavily influenced by [Saunders' Progressive Transformers](https://github.com/BenSaunders27/ProgressiveTransformersSLP), with some modifications and additional scripts. These include scripts for performing regression stacking on Progressive Transformers, creating datasets for regression stacking, training meta-models, and training PCK approximator models to be used as loss functions during the Transformers training.

Since the original code for Progressive Transformers was taken from Saunders' repository, I left the original README with the instructions in the folder.

The datasets used for all tasks of this dissertation were taken from: https://github.com/SignDiff/Processed-Data

The best models of Progressive Transformer and meta-models described in the report paper can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xr-ZaWe5oijBjIsRYECDinpeTVn3nYG1?usp=sharing
